            <h1 id="top">Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities</h1><p>This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released
versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2.  Each
vulnerability is given a security <a href="/security/impact_levels.html">impact rating</a> by the Apache
security team - please note that this rating may well vary from
platform to platform.  We also list the versions of Apache httpd the
flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list
the version with a question mark.  </p><p> Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed
in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to
the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.</p><p> Please send comments or corrections for
these vulnerabilities to the <a href="/security_report.html">Security
Team</a>.  </p><p><h3>Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used.   This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life.  Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here.  Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.</h3></p><br/><h1 id="2.2.35-never">

    <name name="CVE-2017-9798">Use-after-free when using &lt;Limit &gt; with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed")</name>
    (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9798">CVE-2017-9798</a>)
  </h3>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an &lt;Limit {method}&gt;
directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the
corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current
worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour.</p>
    <p>This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global
httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later.</p>
    <p>To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the &lt;Limit &gt; directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive.</p>
